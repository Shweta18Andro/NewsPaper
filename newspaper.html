                Mistakes in question papers disturb the concentration of children. This is why the board should implement an error-free
                exam campaign along with the copy-free exam campaign,” said a teacher.<p>Mumbai: The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education’s (MSBSHSE) Class 12 examination started
                on Tuesday with an error in the English question paper. It was no different on Wednesday. This time errors in printing
                serial numbers were found in the Hindi question paper.
                </p>In question two, the ‘opposites’ of four words were to be written. However, the serial numbers of these words were
                printed as 1, 2, 1, 2, instead of 1, 2, 3, 4. Similarly, serial numbers to write four ‘similar words’ were numbered 1,
                1, 1, 1, rather than 1, 2, 3, 4.
                
                Many students got confused as they could answer only by writing the serial number. “Mistakes in question papers disturb
                the concentration of children. This is why the board should implement an error-free exam campaign along with the
                copy-free exam campaign,” said a teacher. Sharad Gosavi, chairman of the board, could not be contacted on the board’s
                decision regarding these mistakes.
                <p>Meanwhile, teacher’s boycott continues
                
                Mukund Andhalkar, conveyer of the Maharashtra State Federation of the Junior College Teachers Organisation (MSFJCTO)
                said, “We had an almost two-hour meeting with school education minister Deepak Kesarkar on Wednesday, but no concrete
                decision was taken in the meeting. The education minister has given a positive response. After receiving the minutes of
                this discussion, the MSFJCTO executive decide whether or not to continue with the boycott.”</p>

                    Almost exactly a year ago, I was in Sydney with some of the most astute strategic analysts of the western world. We were
                    discussing, predictably, the consequences of the new war in Ukraine. I cannot remember even one brilliant thought leader
                    there contesting the general sense of the house — that Russian President Vladimir Putin made a dreadful mistake; not
                    only would the war be concluded within weeks in Ukraine’s favour, but also Russia would almost disappear into the sands
                    of history, and so would Putin.

                <p>I was also counselled that if I had any influence in New Delhi, I should advise the Government of India that this is
                India’s moment. New Delhi had the choice of bandwagoning with the West or to cynically do what seems to come naturally:
                Sit on the fence.</p>
                <p>The former, I was told, would bring huge strategic dividends and the latter would shame India and position it even more firmly as an unlikely ally unwilling to take responsibility for the management of the international system.</p>

                    </span>
                Examination anxiety limits your outlook on life, your academic or professional performance, as well as how you live your
                daily life since your body starts to feel anxious weeks before the exam and it reaches a high on the day of the exam.
                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, exam anxiety frequently has a negative impact on your academic achievement.

                        Resolve the stray dog problem in our cities

                </div>
                <p>The tragic death of a four-year-old boy after being mauled by a pack of stray dogs in Hyderabad spotlights a long
                neglected problem with deep roots in rapidly expanding urban populations generating mountains of municipal and food waste and inadequate efforts by civic authorities to contain the problem.
                </p>

                <p>There are mainly two reasons that push up the stray dog population — access to food and abandonment by pet owners. In
                the absence of a robust disposal system, most urban waste is discarded in open spaces, attracting dogs. In some cases,
                owners abandon pets — who breed and multiply.
                </p>
                <p>
                Only a judicious mix of short-term emergency measures and long-term shifts in civic behaviour can help reduce the number of stray dogs and their dangers in urban spaces.
